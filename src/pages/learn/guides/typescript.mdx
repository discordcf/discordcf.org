`discord.cf` supports TypeScript out of the box. You can use the `.ts` files in your `src/` folder, and you can transpile it automatically
to JavaScript for your Cloudflare Worker.

Using TypeScript, you can prevent errors at runtime by defining the shapes of your objects. Also, types provide the developer information
and teach how to use the framework. For example, you could look for the type definition and learn about the components of the object in question.

You donâ€™t need to write TypeScript code in your bot projects to benefit from it. The framework always treats your component code as TypeScript.

Check out both JavaScript and TypeScript templates:
