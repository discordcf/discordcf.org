The first thing you need to do is to start your project.
For that we've set up a [template repository](https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template) in Github
with all the boilerplate.

If you use Github, you can [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) through the UI.
Or you can clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template.git my-bot
```

## Prerequisites

There are a couple steps you need to fulfill before actually testing your bot:

- Create a Discord account.
- Create a Cloudflare account.
- Download `@cloudflare/wrangler2`.

### Set up your Discord account

If you haven't registered to Discord, please do it [here](https://discord.com/register/).
After you have your Discord account you should create your developer app.
Go to your [developer profile](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set up a new application.

For a detailed guide read ["Set up your Discord Application"](/learn/appendix/set-up-your-discord-application).

### Set up your Cloudflare account

Go to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and sign up on their site. Once you've signed up, you'll find a lot of
services provided by Cloudflare but for this starting guide, we'll just focus on Cloudflare Workers.

For a detailed guide read ["Set up your Cloudflare Account"](/learn/appendix/set-up-your-cloudflare-account).

### Get started with Wrangler

The last requirement is getting started with `@cloudflare/wrangler2`.
This command line tool will help you to easily deploy your bot on Cloudflare.
The official documentation can be accessed in [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/).

For our detailed guide how to configure wrangler, read ["Hooking up wrangler"](/learn/guides/hooking-up-wrangler).

### Deep-dive into the code

Check out the [guide](/learn/guides/set-up-your-bot) on how to set up your bot's code.

## Use the example bot

The bot that comes with the starter template is simply a bot that greets you when you execute the `/hello` slash command.

<img class="self-center" src="/hello.png" alt="hello-command" width="75%" />

### Inviting the bot to your server

Assuming you've read the above guides and that you have already configured your Discord application and bot,
Cloudflare will provide you with a link to your worker that should look like `https://rainy-jungle-498a.discordcf.workers.dev`.
If you put that link in your browser, you'll be redirected to a site where you will be able to add the deployed bot to any server you
have the required permissions; if you can't do that, talk to the owner of the server.

<img class="self-center" src="/invite-bot.png" alt="hello-command" width="40%" />

When you do this, you'll see the bot added to your server.

### Install the commands

> If you'd like to instantly see the commands on your server, don't forget to set up
> the `GUILD_ID` environment variable in your deployment.

After that, the only left thing to do is to install the bot commands.
For that, every bot that is deployed with this framework exposes a `/setup` endpoint.
You just need to perform a `GET` request with your browser, and it'll be installed.
You should see a similar response to this:

```json
{
  "hello": {
    "id": "1046977140899450951",
    "application_id": <your-application-id>,
    "version": "1046977140899450952",
    "default_permission": true,
    "default_member_permissions": null,
    "type": 1,
    "name": "hello",
    "name_localizations": null,
    "description": "A simple hello message.",
    "description_localizations": null,
    "guild_id": <your-guild-id>
  }
}
```

Congrats! Now your `hello-bot` should be ready to respond.
