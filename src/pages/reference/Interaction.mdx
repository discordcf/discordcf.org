`Interaction` is a class that represents any sort of interaction.

```typescript
const interaction: Interaction = ctx.interaction;
```

## Usage

You should never create an `Interaction` object yourself as `Context` already creates it for you upon receiving
an interaction from Discord.

Generally used through `ctx`.

```typescript
const interactionStructure: APIInteraction = ctx.interaction.structure;
```

## Reference

<div class="m-0 flex justify-start">
  <span class="rounded-md bg-slate-300 py-2 px-4 font-source-code-pro dark:bg-[#ffffff16]">Interaction</span>
</div>

### Methods
