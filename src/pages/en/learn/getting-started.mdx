## What is discord.cf?

discord.cf is a framework to build your own Discord bots on top Cloudflare Workers.

## Start your first bot

The first thing you need to do is to start your project. For that we've set up a [template repository](https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template) in Github
with all the boilerplate.

If you use Github, you can [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) through the UI.
Or you can clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template.git my-bot
```

### Use the starter bot

There are a couple steps you need to fulfill before actually testing your bot:

- Create a Discord account.
- Create a Cloudflare account.
- Download `@cloudflare/wrangler2`.

#### Set up your Discord account

If you haven't registered to Discord, please do it [here](https://discord.com/register/).

```typescript
import { createApplicationCommandHandler, Permissions, type ApplicationCommandHandler } from "cloudflare-discord-bot";
import { hug } from "./hug";

export type EnvInterface = {
  // Secrets
  applicationId: string;
  botToken: string;
  publicKey: string;
};

let handler: ApplicationCommandHandler;
export default {
  fetch: (req: Request, env: EnvInterface, context: ExecutionContext) => {
    if (handler === undefined) {
      handler = createApplicationCommandHandler({
        applicationId: env.applicationId,
        botToken: env.botToken,
        publicKey: env.publicKey,
        // Optional guildId for development
        // guildId: "",
        commands: [hug],
        permissions: new Permissions([]),
      });
    }
    return handler(req, env, context);
  },
};
```

> A Markdown/MDX layout will have access to all its fileâ€™s exported properties from Astro.props with some key differences:
>
> - Heading information (i.e. `h1 -> h6` elements) is available via the headings array, rather than a getHeadings() function.
> - `file` and url are also available as nested frontmatter properties (i.e. frontmatter.url and frontmatter.file).
> - Values defined outside of frontmatter (e.g. export statements in MDX) are not available. Consider [importing a layout instead](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/#importing-layouts-manually-mdx).
