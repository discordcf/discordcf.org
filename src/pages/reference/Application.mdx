`Application` is an interface that will allow you to properly define the object that you need to initialize your bot.

```typescript
interface Application {
  applicationId: string;
  botToken: string;
  publicKey: string;
  guildId?: string;
  commands: Command[];
  components?: MessageComponent[];
  permissions: Permissions;
}
```

## Usage

When you create your `index.{ts,js}` file you should define an `application` variable that has all the information
needed. Keep in mind the `guildId` is optional, and if you don't set it, you will install the commands globally;
means the commands will get updated in 1 hour.

```typescript
import { createApplicationCommandHandler, Permissions } from "@discordcf/framework";
import yourCommand from "./cmd/your-command";
import yourComponent from "./components/your-component";

const application: Application = {
  applicationId: env.APPLICATION_ID,
  publicKey: env.PUBLIC_KEY,
  botToken: env.BOT_TOKEN,
  commands: [yourCommand],
  components: [yourComponent],
  guildId: env.GUILD_ID,
  permissions: new Permissions([
    "AddReactions",
    "AttachFiles",
    "EmbedLinks",
    "SendMessages",
    "SendTTSMessages",
    "MentionEveryone",
    "UseExternalEmojis",
    "UseExternalStickers",
  ]),
};

const applicationCommandHandler = createApplicationCommandHandler(application, env, context);
```
