`Permissions` is a class used to define the permissions your bot will have in your server.

```typescript
const permissions = new Permissions(types);
```

## Usage

It's only used when you first define your `Application` object. You need to define all the permissions you want for your bot to have
in your server.

```typescript
const application: Application = {
  // Other fields above
  permissions: new Permissions([
    "AddReactions",
    "AttachFiles",
    "EmbedLinks",
    "SendMessages",
    "SendTTSMessages",
    "MentionEveryone",
    "UseExternalEmojis",
    "UseExternalStickers",
  ]),
};
```
