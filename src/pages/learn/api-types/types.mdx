Since we encourage developers to use TypeScript rather than JavaScript, we've deliberately decided not to create our own
Discord API types library.
A very successful library has been available for quite some time now, and that one is [`discord-api-types`](https://discord-api-types.dev/)
built and maintained by the folks from `discordjs`.

## API versioning

Discord supports a REST API to interact with the servers. This REST API is versioned by using semantic versioning, and nowadays
Discord supports quite a few versions for their API.

Discord API Types is exposing the types following that semantic versioning convention. So we decided to export from our package their types, so you don't need to install `discord-api-types` into your package directly, it'll be a transient dependency for you.
Since this is a beta version we're only exposing the latest version of these types, and from there, we'll see how it goes and how the community interactrs with it.

So for instance, if for some reason you want some type that is not in this documentation, most likely you'll need to visit their docs page.

## Example

Remember when you defined your first command and its handler, the signature had to be like this:

```typescript
async (ctx: Context): Promise<APIInteractionResponse>
```

The type `APIInteractionResponse`, even though you import from `@discordcf/framework`, it's a `discord-api-types` type, and you'd need to visit this [link](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/next/discord-api-types-v10#APIInteractionResponse) to find out what it is.
