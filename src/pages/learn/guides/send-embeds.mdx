Sending embeds is a beautiful way to interact with the users.
At the moment, we don't have classes, methods or functions set for you to call as other libraries have.
But this is a great example to show the flexibility of this framework.
Even if we haven't implemented a specific feature, you
could still achieve the results you want. Yes, with an extra effort though.

## Introduction

So embeds are certainly part of the [Message Structure](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object-message-structure). So in a single message, you could send an array of embeds.
Essentially, you just need to create your embed objects following the [Embed Object Structure](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object).

## Code

```typescript
import { Command, InteractionResponseType, Context, APIInteractionResponse } from "@discordcf/framework";

export const embedCommand: Command = {
  command: {
    name: "embed",
    description: "A sample embed message",
  },
  handler: async (ctx: Context): Promise<APIInteractionResponse> => {
    // ctx will remain unused
    return {
      type: InteractionResponseType.ChannelMessageWithSource,
      data: {
        content: "Some embed",
        embeds: [
          {
            color: 0x0099ff,
            title: "Some title",
            description: "Some description",
            url: "https://github.com/discordcf/discordcf",
            author: {
              name: "Some name",
              icon_url: "https://pub-f074cead5eaf408790b463b05f6e8b32.r2.dev/discordcf/logo.png",
              url: "https://github.com/discordcf/discordcf",
            },
            thumbnail: {
              url: "https://pub-f074cead5eaf408790b463b05f6e8b32.r2.dev/discordcf/logo.png",
            },
            fields: [
              {
                name: "Regular field title",
                value: "Some value",
              },
              {
                name: "\u200B",
                value: "\u200B",
              },
              {
                name: "Inline field title",
                value: "Some value",
                inline: true,
              },
              {
                name: "Inline field title",
                value: "Some value",
                inline: true,
              },
            ],
            footer: {
              text: "Some footer text",
              icon_url: "https://pub-f074cead5eaf408790b463b05f6e8b32.r2.dev/discordcf/logo.png",
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    };
  },
};

export default embedCommand;
```

The code is really simple, you just create a command. Then, you just need to add the embeds in your response object.

</div>
