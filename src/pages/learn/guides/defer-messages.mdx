This is a feature that may be useful for many of you.
Discord allows the bots to send deferred messages to the user as well as follow-up messages.

## Code

```typescript
import { Command, InteractionResponseType, MessageFlags, Context, APIInteractionResponse } from '@discordcf/framework';

export const deferredCommand: Command = {
  command: {
    name: 'deferred',
    description: 'A deferred message',
  },
  handler: async (ctx: Context): Promise<APIInteractionResponse> => {
    ctx.defer(async (ctx: Context): Promise<void> => {
      await ctx.followup.reply({ content: 'Message was deferred' });
      await ctx.followup.reply({ content: 'This is a follow up message' });
    });

    return {
      type: InteractionResponseType.DeferredChannelMessageWithSource,
      data: {
        flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
      },
    };
  },
};

export default deferredCommand;
```

So your command will look like this:

- You need the `command` key as well as the `handler` key.
- The signature of the `handler` is the same as all of our commands.
- You will be using the `Context` API to follow-up on a messagae you initially sent.
- The `type` of message you will be sending initially is `DeferredChannelMessageWithSource`.
- A flag must be set to `Ephemeral` as the message will be only there for a brief moment.
- The `Context` API allows you to declaratively tell the bot to reply to the message initially sent.

## What happened?

So the user sent the `/deferred` command to our bot. Then, Discord sent a webhook interaction to our endpoint and the handler
was executed. Keep in mind the connection flow we shallowly described in [Reply on command](/learn/guides/reply-on-command).

There's a connection that begins with the request and ends with the response. So you perfectly say that the connection should end
after we sent the ephemeral response. Well, keep reading...

The first thing the handler does is calling the `defer()` method to defer any sort of code you put inside — the code must be in the form of a callback function — The defer method will allow the worker to keep processing the task you defined
after the response has been sent for a given period of time, you can't process forever. The limit is 30 seconds, and this a Cloudflare
hard limit. So, don't run tasks that take more than 30 seconds to send a follow-up message.

Let's rewind a little bit. When the interaction arrives for the first time the `ctx` object will store that interaction that has all the infromation needed to create a follow-up message. Then, whenever you call the `ctx.followup.reply()` method, it'll know what message needs be followed; by default, it's the latest.
