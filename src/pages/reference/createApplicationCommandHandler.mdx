`createApplicationHandler` is a function that will handle any request to your bot.

```typescript
const applicationHandler = createApplicationCommandHandler(application, env, context);
```

## Usage

In your `index.{js,ts}` file you will initilize your bot by creating the application handler.

```typescript
import { createApplicationCommandHandler, Permissions } from '@discordcf/framework';
import yourCommmand from './cmd/your-command';
import yourComponent from './components/your-component';

let applicationCommandHandler: (request: Request) => Promise<Response>;

export interface Env {
  APPLICATION_ID: string;
  CLIENT_SECRET: string;
  PUBLIC_KEY: string;
  BOT_TOKEN: string;
  GUILD_ID?: string;
}

export default {
  fetch: async (request: Request, env: Env, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> => {
    if (!applicationCommandHandler) {
      applicationCommandHandler = createApplicationCommandHandler(
        {
          applicationId: env.APPLICATION_ID,
          publicKey: env.PUBLIC_KEY,
          botToken: env.BOT_TOKEN,
          commands: [yourCommand],
          components: [yourComponent],
          guildId: env.GUILD_ID,
          permissions: new Permissions([
            'AddReactions',
            'SendMessages',
          ]),
        },
        env,
        context,
      );
    }
    return applicationCommandHandler(request);
  },
};
```
