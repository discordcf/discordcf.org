Wrangler is the Cloudflare tool for you to deploy your workers on Cloudflare.
In this guide, we'll just cover the basics to get your started with your bots, and if you want to get more involved with this tool,
we recomend that you follow the [Cloudflare Wrangler Official Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).

## Config file

The config file that you'll find in your project is `wrangler.toml` in which you'll need to configure in order to get your bots on Cloudflare.

We assume that you have already installed it in your local machine, and that you can check the wrangler version you've got.

```bash
❯ wrangler --version
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.4.0 (update available 2.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------------
```

If you started your project with one of our templates, you'll find the file `wrangler.toml` ready to be used.
The only thing you will need to add is configuration to create your environments, bindings, and so forth.

## Environment variables

Variables that are not meant to be secret can be added in the `wrangler.toml` file like in this example.

```toml
compatibility_date = "2022-10-20"
account_id = "590d5e6a4382a813b506fa45ca1609e0"
main = "src/index.ts"

[build]
command = "npm install && npm run build"

[env.test]
name = "a-deployment-name"
workers_dev = true

[env.test.vars]
APPLICATION_ID = "your application id"
PUBLIC_KEY = "your public key"
```

The variables that are under the scope `env.test.vars` will be used whenever you run:

```bash
❯ wrangler publish -e test
```

## Secrets

Other type of variables are meant to be secret such as the `GUILD_ID`, `BOT_TOKEN`, so on and so forth.
For that you can add those by executing from a terminal the following command:

```bash
❯ wrangler secret put GUILD_ID -e test
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.4.0 (update available 2.6.2)
-----------------------------------------------------
Enter a secret value:
```

You will need to enter the secret value. This is recommended to do before publishing your bot.
