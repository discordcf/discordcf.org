## What is this?

It's a framework to build your own Discord bots on top Cloudflare Workers.

## Start your first bot

The first thing you need to do is to start your project.
For that we've set up a [template repository](https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template) in Github
with all the boilerplate.

If you use Github, you can [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) through the UI.
Or you can clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/discordcf/starter-bot-template.git my-bot
```

### Use the starter bot

There are a couple steps you need to fulfill before actually testing your bot:

- Create a Discord account.
- Create a Cloudflare account.
- Download `@cloudflare/wrangler2`.

#### Set up your Discord account

If you haven't registered to Discord, please do it [here](https://discord.com/register/).
After you have your Discord account you should create your developer app.
Go to your [developer profile](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set up a new application.

For a detailed guide read ["Set up your Discord Application"](/en/learn/appendix/set-up-your-discord-application).

#### Set up your Cloudflare account

Go to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and sign up on their site. Once you've signed up, you'll find a lot of
services provided by Cloudflare but for this starting guide, we'll just focus on Cloudflare Workers.

For a detailed guide read ["Set up your Cloudflare Account"](/en/learn/appendix/set-up-your-cloudflare-account).
